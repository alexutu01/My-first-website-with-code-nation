<h3><b>About Me:</b></h3>
<p>Do you want to know something about me? I will immediately tell you a small part of what I am, what I believe, and what I feel.</p>
<p>My name is Alex, or as the top of the page says Alexandru Potra, and I'm 31 years old. I think there are few people who really know me. I can't say I'm a simple or easy-to-understand person, but time will reveal that I'm an awesome person and easy going once you get to know me.I'm a strong believer that trust is earned! I'm a contradictory, complicated person but not imposible, and I really appreciate people who try to understand me and are in no hurry to judge me. I like nerdy and geeky stuff, always have, I like to know how things work how they function and what is their purpose. I grew up in the 90's and I remember thinking, if they can make a phone that you can take with you out of the house, what else are they capable of. Little did I know that in 2020 we will have mobile phones with all touch screen and any information we want or need is at our finger tips. Makes me wonder where will we be in 20 years from know, which brings me to the reason why I decided to take a course in web developing from <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">CodeNation</a>.</p>
<p> I want to be part of the future, and to pursue a career in coding, either front end developer or back end developer. It never crossed my mind that in three weeks of begginer coding I will actually understand and be abel to code, and create a web site never the less. Don't get me wrong, I don't pretend to be a master coder, far from it, but from the experience I've acumulated from CodeNation's course I am confident that I can progress and learn code and exceed expectations if given the opportunity.</p>
<br>
<p> I'm going to ramble now a littel bit about my education. To start, I have a bachelor's degree in <strong>Comunication and Public Relations</strong> and a Master's degree in <strong>Advertising</strong>. As an introvert, getting a degree in comunication and public relations was a big thing and it really helped me to get out of my shell. I know you migh think that it wasn't a good idea given the fact that I never intended to pursue a career in PR, but I've actully learn a lot in those three years. Only when I decided to get my master's degree in Advertising, I've felt that might be a career that I'd like to follow, lets not forget that my mind also went to the possibility of computer science university, but soon forgot about the idea as I wasn't confident in my abilities to comprehend anything related to coding or web developing. Anyway, I soon found out that as much as I love advertising, commercials, and everything about this subject, the part of europe that I'm from, was not ready and on board with more daring ideas. </p>
<br>
<p> From my managerial skills acumulated over the years working in hospitality and running the family bussiness in the same sector, I've learned to manage teams on all levels, achiveing targets and meet fantastic people on the way, regardless of their social status. Try not to judge a book by its cover on first impresion, you never know how it might surprise you. Even if might be judged incorrectly some times, given the opportunity I can prove myself no mater the circumstances, I'm stubborn like that ;). </p>
<br>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my website, and please be gentile with the criticisms as this is my first web site and my first attempt at HTML and CSS, or Python for that matter. </p>
