    <h3><b>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </b></h3>
    <p> Technology, the way it operates in the IT industry, is constantly evolving because there is a convergence between business strategies and technology. We are on the threshold of major changes that will fundamentally affect the way we live, work, relate to others, we can already see this evolving even quicker due to the covid19 pandemic. There are transformations that we have not had the opportunity to experience so far.The possibilities created by todays technological achievements create the opportunity for billions of people to connect through mobile devices,such as mobile phones, tablets, smart watches and many more, with an unprecedented processing capacity, with a storage capacity that we could not have imagined a few years ago, and which allow direct and unrestricted access to any kind of knowledge, whatever these may be. The digital transformation carries with it the potential to generate higher incomes, to reach higher levels of productivity and efficiency never seen in the management of resources so far and, last but not least, the possibility to increase the quality of life. But at the same time, there is the potential to trigger new waves of inequality, especially with huge disruptive potential for the labor market. The best example for this is Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon. His wealth has almost doubled during the covid19 pandemic, due to the lockdown. People starting buying most of the things they need,or want, online. Due to the immense wealth that he achieved probably the next step will be the automatization of all sections of the business, which will lead to people loosing their jobs. In essence the purpose of IT strategies in moders business has become an essential, and a must have, in our day and age. They play an important role in industries such as sales, advertising, socializing, freedom of speach or accessing the information we need at a touch of a button or a screen.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </b></h3>
    <p> As is in any industry, digital projects require a set of knowledges, skills and techniques to project activities in order to meet or exceed the needs and expectations of all the parties involved. In order to start a digital project, one must make shure that the fundamentals to achieveing the goals are present and in working order. I now shall enumerate some crucial tools needed in a digital project:<ul>
                <li><b>A good laptop, desktop or tablet</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>with stable internet connection</li>
                    <li>with a good antivirus instaled </li>
                    <li>backup drivers in case all of the above fail</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Software relevant to your project, to enumerate some:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual Studio Code (most popular) <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Learn more</a></li></li>

                </ul>
            </ul>

    </p>
    <h3><b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </b></h3>
    <p> As in any other project and tasks you have decide exactly what you want to achieve. A real goal is clear, specific, measurable and inscribed in a period of time. Write down the goals of the project. This will strengthen your confidence that you will be able to achieve those goals. Be willing to pay the price. Estimate what you will have to do in addition or what you will have to give up to achieve those goals. Draw up a detailed plan. Choose an important goal for yourself and write down all the steps you need to take to reach it. Depending on this, you will set your priorities in the short and long term and you will not waste time with all kinds of activities that distract you from fulfilling your goal. Act according to plan. Once you have made the plan and clearly set your priorities you need to do "something".</p>
    <p> As stated previously, all of the above are crucial tools to start and complete a digital project, but it feels like something is missing... PLANNING... Thats right, planning reprezents a big part in succesfully achieveing your goals and targets in a project, whatever this might be, digital or any type of project for that mater. A good tool used for properly organize your tasks and goals in a project will be <a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank">Trello</a> which is a good way to organise <i>"boards, lists, and cards, enable teams to organize and prioritize projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way"</i>. As I also mentioned in the first question, the accesability to information today is so vast that whatever you need is at a fingertip away, you just need to be able and willing to access it. After all this you still dont't feel confortable with tour abilities, there are a lot of online courses that can put you in the right way, to name one, <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a> </i> which will provide you with the knoledge to start your own digital project.</p>
    <h3><b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects. </b></h3>
    <p> Any conscious process has a certain degree of uncertainty that cannot be eliminated. Uncertainty in the modern conception is a broader notion that includes both negative and positive aspects, so uncertainty cannot be confused with risk. While the risk is considered to have a negative aspect, the favorable circumstances represent the positive aspects of a process. Projects must be managed taking into account the fact that there are always favorable risks and circumstances. All the people involved in a project should be encouraged to anticipate, identify both risks and favorable circumstances and report them to the project organization. That is why the risk and opportunity management plan once developed must be applied effectively throughout the project life cycle.</p>
    <p>Some of the risks of a project can be:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Technical aspects</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>the basic idea of the project is flawed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Financial aspects</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>unrealistic estimation of the budget needed to carry out the project</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Managerial Aspects</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>incorrect estimation of activities, incompetence of the project manager</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Work team formation</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>defective teamwork, low qualification of team members or failure to cover project-specific areas of competence</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Defective technology transfer</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li> non-compliance with the conditions imposed on the application of the developed technology, the obtained products do not have the forecasted characteristics</li>
                </ul>
            
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Other impediments and risks to a failed project could be that some or all of the tools listed in question 1.1 are not working properly, such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>the laptop or any other device you use is not functioning correctly</li>
            <li>the internet connection is unstabile</li>
            <li>antivirus not instaled </li>
            <li>did not backup your work</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </b></h3>
    <p>The IT sistems and software in a digital project will be selected according to the goals of the project. When dealing with the project we need to take in consideration the following:
        <ol>
            <li> Projects must be delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Projects must be included in the costs.</li>
            <li> Projects must fall within the scope.</li>
            <li> Projects must meet the quality requirements of customers.</li>
        </ol>
    <p> In order for these to be achievable a well established plan needs to be set up. A good way to go about doing that is making a <a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank">Trello</a> board where you can plan your activities on a daily basics or by tasks, such as: to do, doing and done. This will help you organise your project and will help you stay on top of the tasks that still need attencion. Make shure all your software and hardware equipment are functioning the way they should and all the updates are up to date. All of these will be selected according to the project at hand.  </p>
    </p>

    <h3><b>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </b></h3>
    <p>By selecting the best implementation approach for the project to ensure the delivery of a successful outcome, these are achived by using and updating the Trello board. Review and verify functional and technical requirements of the project, in this case we can refer to the course material or other learning platforms like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3schools</a> which are fantastic learning platforms where you will find solutions to your problems. Prepare functional and technical designs, in these case we put in use the abilities of an flowchart, and the best way to do so is by using the ones provided by <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" target="_blank">Draw.io</a>, so you could structure your project better and possibly have a better picture of the structure and the end resolt of the project. </p>
    <p>Execute the test plan to confirm that the solution meets the technical requirements, for this purpose we use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> to write the program and test its functionality. As a final step you will have to deploy the solution in production and provide final project documentation</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects </b></h3>
    <p>Data is often a company’s most critical asset. Businesses globally are collecting increasing amounts of data on customers and partners so they can be more competitive in the marketplace. In the European Union (EU), over 90% of citizens say they want some data protection rights across the EU, regardless of where their data is processed. But why? Because similar to the large data breaches that have occurred in the US , an increasing number of cases have been reported in the EU as well. Consumers around the world are concerned about how their personal data is managed.</p>
    <p>This is where GDPR comes into place, to put simply, the goal of GDPR is to protect the rights of people giving you their data. GDPR provides an opportunity for companies to enhance their existing systems. Technology can power much of the internal change needed to help companies be more responsive and GDPR compliant. It’s important to understand that companies can never outsource their liability to a cloud service provider. Even if you hire a GDPR compliant cloud source provider, your company is still liable.</p>
    <p> The first step is to conduct a readiness assessment of your current data protection compliance programs and set up a roadmap to determine next steps. Conducting a readiness assessment is the best way to ensure the right protective measures are taken. It should be more than just a checklist. Assessments provide a good foundation to assess the potential and ongoing risk of systems and data flows within them. Fines for breach of GDPR are substantial – up to 4% of annual global turnover.</p>
