    <h3><b>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</b></h3>
    <p>Each page can be accessed through the navigation bar that I've created on top the pages. The main page, also known in this case as home page, contains an about me section, which can be accessed by clicking the logo of the page. the about me page contains some of my passions and hobbys an also yhe aducation that I've pursued so far. Contact me button is placed in the right position of the nav bar and contains my contact details. The four buttons in the center of the nav bar are text based content, answering the questions for each unit with it's specific outcome. In these units you will find that I've used Unordered list, Ordered list, Description list, Nested list, and Link buttons that open in different tab so your current browsing is not disturbed.    </p>

    <h3><b>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p> There are no universally accepted or absolute categorizations of disability. Even abilities can vary from person to person, or over time, for different people with the same kind of disability. People can have combinations of different limitations, such as a visual and hearing disability together. Different disabilities sometimes require similar accommodations. For instance, both someone who is blind and someone who cannot use his or her hands require full keyboard support for the commands in browsers and authoring tools, since they both have difficulty using a mouse but can use different assistive technologies to activate commands that are supported by a standard keyboard interface. The number and severity of disabilities tend to increase as people with age, and may include changes in vision, hearing, memory, or motor function, which can be accommodated on the Web as with any other disabilities.
    Some possible solutions:    
    <ol>
        <li>Alternate keyboards or switches</li>
        <li>Braille and refreshable braille</li>
        <li>Screen magnifiers </li>
        <li>Screen readers</li>
        <li>Sound notification</li>
        <li>Scanning software</li>
        <li>Voice recognition</li>
    </ol>
