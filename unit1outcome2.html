    <h3><b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</b></h3>
    <p> First platform taht I'm going to talk about will be <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> which in my opinion is the best, probably because on this platform I've learn to code during the course from Code Nation. It is a easy to use platform, it features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. It has support for hundreds of languages, and it helped me be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more.The intuitive keyboard shortcuts really help when coding, especialy for a bigginer souch as myself. It allows great customization and plugin addition in a simple way. Most of the old code editors are so heavy and not as easy to use as Microsoft Visual Studio Code.The terminal makes it easy to execute programs, tests, and make git changes, plus it will show you on which line of code you have an error so you can fix it and run the program without issues. Its all right there and easily opened with a hotkey. I love that you can even run as many as you want! so one tab can be running a webpack development server, another watching your tests, and another for making git commits, all without leaving the window.</p>
    <p>
        Other tools used through out this project were helpfull in their own way. To enumerate some:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Trello</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>it really helped keeping track of the task at hand, and have a structure of the daily objectives that needed to be achieved</li>
                    <li>the fact that multiple people could have access to it made team work very easy</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>W3school</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>helped a lot when dealing with simple functions and gave a very simple, but to the poin, explenation on how they work and their rol in the code</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>GitHub</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the community on this platform are ready and very happy to help whit any errors you might have in your code that maybe you can't figure it out</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Codepen</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>even though it might be similar to github, code pen mostly focuses primarily on front-end languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and preprocessing syntaxes that turn into those things, and again the community on this platform is ready to help with any problems one might encounter in their code </li>
                </ul>      
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate  </b></h3>
    <p> All the tools used throughout this project had an important role for the end result of the code. VS code as I mentioned before was the primal tool used for the coding part of thing. It was used when writing for the game that we created in the first two weeks of the code nation course, and even when writing content for this web site. Wheater is python language or HTML and CSS, VS code is the software to use. </p>
    <p>And as I mentioned before, other platforms such as Trello, Github or Codepen, had a great role in getting things done in a specific time frame. Trello helped with the daily tasks that needed done, it was great for distributing task amoung team members, and resolving them with ease. Github and Codepen also useful when getting stuck on an error that we just couldn't fix ourselfs or problems to which we just couldn't see the issue.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project </b></h3>
    <p>To be honest, I have to say that I'm not very pleased with this version of the website and I feel that I could have done a better job if given more time, but givent the fact that was not an option I have to say that this is not my best work , rather basic and dosen't not show any high level web developing concepts like asynchronous features or have more complex code. As a possitive note, which one can call a strength, will be the fact that the web site functions as it should, and again I would like to add that time was not on my side for this project, so I had to keep it basic.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </b></h3>
    <p>To begin with, it will be correcting grammar errors and spelling. Maybe a more complex CSS coding as I'm not very pleased with the final rezult of the project, but this is only due to the time limit we had on it. I found it difficult and time consuming when answering and creating the content for every outcome. With more time and resorces I think that this project would have looked much better an probably more interactive and fun. Give in the fact that time was of the essence, some compromises had to be made, by that i mean I had to keep it as simple as possible to get the project done in time. Because I just started my journey in coding and web developing I have to say the process was a bit slow as I had to research a lot of things that I wanted to implement in the project, research which it self was time consuming. In the end I have to say that I am happy with the end result give in the time alocated for it, and I hope that whoever will assess it will feel the same.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </b></h3>
    <p>In my opinion everything on this project ran as smooth as possible, and even though with its basic looking the final product is in working order and functioning without errors. Trello really helped in keeping me on top of the tasks that needed to be done in orther to finish in time. The help and support that I received from my colegues on the slack platform or other platforms like w3school or git hub really helped getting the project done.</p>
