    <h3><b>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</b></h3>
    <p>I really can't find any drawbacks for any IT tools that I've used during this project. VS Code is a fantastic software and very user friendly. Although the final product could look e bit better, it has nothing to do whit the abilities of the tools that I've used in this project. All tools used served their purpose without error, trello boards helped me stay on track and on top of the tasks at hand, and other platforms like github or w3school helped me with issuess that I've encountered along the way. The only drawback, which has nothing to do with the tools that I've used, would be the time frame the project had to be done.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  </b></h3>
    <p>As a fist thing, I would like to point out that productivity and efficiency go hand in hand, and I will list some that I consider important and they can be applied in any project :
        <ol>
            <li>Reduce Distractions</li>
            <li>Have the Right Tools and Equipment</li>
            <li>Improve workplace conditions</li>
            <li>Set Realistic Goals</li>
            <li>Clarify roles and tasks</li>
            <li>Give and receive feedback</li>
            <li>Test everything!</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects </b></h3>
    <p>Given the fact that I have no experience in coding and web developing prior of this course, I think that maybe if we were devided in groups of two we would have been more productive and be more satisfied with the end result. When I say groups I don't mean that we should have worked on the same website, but to help eachother with information and guidance where we feel stuck or maybe run out of ideas. Access to key information regarding a project is very important to increase productivity. </p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </b></h3>
    <p>Begin by making sure that every button on every screen works. You also need to ensure that you can enter simple text into each field without crashing the software, this metod is known as alpha testing. beta testing is another way that your code can be tested, having another pair of eyes looking at the source code can uncover a lot of problems that you might have missed. Make time to run as many of these tests as possible before you hand the code over to anyone else. It is always important to test in your terminal if you are writing python or any other similar language. And if it is HTML-CSS, refresh the page as many times neede or after every change made to the code, to see the final result. </p>
